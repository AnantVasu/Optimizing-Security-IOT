# Optimizing-Security-IOT
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman of Massachusetts Institute of Technology  made history in 1977 when they, after trying numerous approaches over the course of a  year, published the paper which introduced RSA to the world. It would be an  understatement to call the paper revolutionary as they pioneered the field of asymmetric  public-private key cryptosystems. RSA is now one of the most widely used algorithms for  secure data transmission. While Rivest and Shamir were computer scientists, Leonard  Adleman was a mathematician and evidently, there is a lot of mathematics involved in the  working of RSA. It is very thought provoking that with numerous advancements in the field  of mathematics, could there be a way to still improve the quintessential key-exchanging algorithm. This project aims to not only ponder this question but also to answer it with a  unique implementation. It also makes one realize the fact that however revolutionary a thing  may be, there is always a room for improvement that pushes it further towards the ultimate  destination of absolute perfection.
